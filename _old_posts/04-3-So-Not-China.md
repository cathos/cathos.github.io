So...  You're Not Going to China? 

Though I planned to go to China last year to work with GoodWorks Orphan Care, I did not raise enough support to do so. I left the company late last fall because I could not keep up with the tasks I had been assigned here in the States. Therefore, I do not plan to go to China at this time. 

As of this writing, I am looking for work as a coffee roaster in Colorado. I am not opposed to working abroad, nor am I afraid to work in missions or with non-profits. I continue to hold GoodWorks in the highest regard,  and I often pray for them and the work they are doing. 
 
The results of my support raising attempt were discouraging, yet as the Lord wills, so I strive to watch and follow. Brothers,  thank you for considering GoodWorks and me in your prayers.
