![Ethan Moore][1]  

Lead Barista, [GoodWorks Coffee & Tea][2]  
Director of Vocational Training, [GoodWorks Orphan Care][3]

GoodWorks is a not-for-profit company based in Bozeman, MT.  

We work with teenage orphans who have aged out of the adoption system in China, providing education and vocational training in the coffee and tea industry.  

I will be moving to China in the fall of 2015 to work with GoodWorks there. I rely on external support and donations. If you would like to know more about GoodWorks or where I am heading, check out the links above, [read my support letter][4], or send me an [email][7]. I accept donations and support [here][5] (not tax-deductible) or through checks mailed to my church, [Generation Ministries][6] (tax deductible):
