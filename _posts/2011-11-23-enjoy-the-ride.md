Sometimes we fall. Everyone does.  
It doesn&#8217;t matter. Life is hard.  
Sometimes it takes a long time to get back up. It&#8217;s okay. Falling hurts, and the memories of the pain tend to weigh heavier on us than the memories of how great it was to be up there. It is only important that you always do your best to enjoy every part of the journey, no matter how much it hurts, and no matter how long you spend on the ground after you fall. 

Enjoy the ride.
