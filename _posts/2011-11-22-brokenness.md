I am broken. I am needy, and I am incomplete. I am unloved.

I long for the touch of a hand, a cheek pressed to mine, of someone who cares for me.
I long for the deep, meaningful conversations that change the world.
I long for the quick glance in an instant fully shared.
I long for the embrace of a hello even long before the bittersweet embrace of a goodbye.
I long to be the best I can be at something (but I'm too afraid to practice at it).

I need human contact.
I need emotional contact.
I need physical contact.
I need beauty.

I hate that I need anything.  
I hate that I want anything.  
I hate that I hate things about myself.

I can't fix this alone.

I hope I never have to.  
I love you all; I hope you see that in what I do;  
I hope that you really know that I love you deeply.

Forgive me for letting go of friendship so easily and for taking too long to form strong bonds.

You are human and so am I.
