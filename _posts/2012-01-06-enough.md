Enough: A Decision of Love

Why am I waiting to make a difference? I am enough now.

Hold tightly to what you truly love, and let everything else fall away and become truly simple.  
&#8220;Holding to what you truly love is the heartâ€™s way to simplify your life.&#8221; &#8211; Diana Lorence

I will let my love for Christ shape my life. It alone is worthwhile.  
The price I will pay for living simply is surrendering everything but my one true love.  
Living in this way is neither prudent nor secure, but it is ultimately worthwhile.  
All my other ambitions have no importance in comparison to Christ.  
I pledge to live for Christ alone.
