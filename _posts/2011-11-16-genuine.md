&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am tempted to be devious. I enjoy disappearing and hiding behind the masks I am accustomed to wearing. However, there is so much worth in transparency, in being who I am. I am a simple lover of nature, of beauty, of life.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am always tempted to be distant. I am an introvert; I am paranoid that I will be predictable and easy. It is so much better to be understandable, reachable, and loving. People reach out to others who aren&#8217;t afraid of who they are.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotional masks are what I slide into, but there are other ways people hide. Many hide behind name brands, clothing, or cleanliness. This is no better than hiding your emotions. You are not a brand. Be who you are, in action and in appearance. That attracts people more than anything else.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being genuine is worth more than you can imagine. Don&#8217;t be afraid. Be yourself.
