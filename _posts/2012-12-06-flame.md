I bought a candle last week, but I&#8217;ve found that it does not make sense.  
It is a glass jar, filled with scented wax and a small stick of wood.  
It smells wonderful, and crackles gently like a small fire.  
But it provides too little light to read by.

It provides a sense of warmth by smell, but provides little light or heat.  
What use is a flame without these?
