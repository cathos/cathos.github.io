My name is Ethan Moore. Today I start over.  

What you are reading is a platform for me to improve my writing through sharing my thoughts.  
I will do my best to write frankly, with candor, succinctly, truthfully, and eloquently.  
My interests are concentrated around voluntary simplicity, compassion, Christian faith, and seeking beauty.
