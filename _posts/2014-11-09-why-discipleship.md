            A few days ago, one of my good friends asked me why our church focuses primarily on discipleship. She feels that we push for individual one-on-one discipleship too much,  that not everyone is called to discipleship.  
              At the time,  I wanted to agree on the grounds that I have not yet really discipled anyone and I have no real prospects in mind to begin discipling. However, after much consideration and prayer, I realize that I am still called to discipleship.  The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) is entirely universal to all who are called:

> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. (ESV)

              Jesus calls us all Christians to go out and make disciples as He made disciples.
