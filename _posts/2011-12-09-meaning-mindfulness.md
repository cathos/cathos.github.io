&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing every day is extremely difficult, and not necessarily worthwhile if I want to publish essays that are meaningful and communicate their message well. Stress certainly doesn&#8217;t help the writing process &#8211; it may help me write quickly, but it drastically degrades my writing&#8217;s quality. My work is sloppy when rushed.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I haven&#8217;t been writing much. I have been very stressed without reason. My work is going well, and I am looking forward to the future, but I have completely lost all hold on mindfulness. I have become too comfortable and I have stopped pushing myself.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past two weeks, I have had a very difficult time paying attention to much of anything. Mindfulness is very important, but sometimes it is very hard to maintain. I realize that sometimes everyone will fall back into being comfortable, but it is always possible to strive for clarity. If you continue resisting, eventually the temptation will lessen, and you can escape life&#8217;s routine far more easily.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get back to mindfulness, change your perspective. Slow down and stop to observe your surroundings. Observe the sensations of your body as you go about the day. Close your eyes and breathe. Feel the wind on your face, feel the cold, an old friend welcoming you outside. Listen to the world that surrounds you. Just breathe.
