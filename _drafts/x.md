For me, the hardest part of every project or every topic is three-quarters of the way through. I have strength to endure through to the end, I am smart enough to finish well. But in the midst of enduring training, in seeking mastery of a subject, the initial difficulties fade away and the everyday difficulties of constantly maintaining mastery set in. I must repeat old excercises and pursue the end of an infinite learning curve. As I approach complete mastery, the gap between me and perfect lessens. This only clarifies the infinite nature of the small distance between me and who I wish I were. Mastery of myself is an unattainable thing. As this realization approaches in any discipline, I grow bored in the tedium of daily maintenance, daily practice. This is the cost of true discipline.
