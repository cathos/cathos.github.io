The void tempts me. It never relents, sings to me without end. I stand on the edge, longing for the song to deepen, my heart to quicken, my broken pieces to render, to clarify a soul at my core.
I stand at the division between ground and void: tendons strained, crouched as a predator, hair on end. I long not for the firmament, but for the sky.
The calling melody comes at every true choice: leap, break, buy, publish, go. The trigger press satisfies, alarms only once pressure breaks. Rage moves to, calls for stillness.
