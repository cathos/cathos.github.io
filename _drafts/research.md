	There are many problems with research. A great many of them arise from people ignoring the difference between observation and truth. Scientific inquiry may inform our view of reality; it may change how we see truth. But research and the conclusions, theories, and laws we draw from it have no real hold on any reality other than our own.
	A painting of a waterfall cannot affect the waterfall it depicts, and it may not depict the waterfall accurately even at the moment it was painted. The painter may have changed the waterfall as he watched, but the strokes of his brush and the texture of the canvas and oil know nothing of what they depict.
	A model of a plant's growth may accurately predict the influence of different genetic, nutritive, or environmental conditions upon how the plant will grow, but it cannot predict how any plant will look when it has grown. The model cannot be as complete as reality, and neither can it change the reality it depicts.
	The measurements that go into paintings and models alike may affect the variables they measure. By measuring the length of a twig, I will most likely move it, move the air around it, effecting pieces of my environment upon the twig's environment. Perhaps I will break the twig, or rub off some small amount of it by picking it up to measure. These things may have no effect on the reality of the twig's length to the degree with which I measured it, but if the same measurements are repeated countless times, the length of the twig may change because we measured it.
	Biased evaluations of honest data occur just as frequently as honest evaluations of biased data. The recognition of bias cannot eradicate it, but in recognizing bias we recognize that there is a problem. When a scientist presents his reality as fact, he becomes more philosopher, more storyteller, and less scientist. His reality comes with data, apparently supported by derivative calculations and assumptions that do not validate, that may be science but not truth.
	Science is based in skepticism. It is the questioning of the known and the verifying of attributes of the unknown. It is the replacer of mythologies, the very depth of faith in our reality. However, due to the transcendentental nature of its exploration of reality, it cannot create nor absolutely define that reality or its limits.
	Science is dependent on mathematics: on empirical measurements, data, and models. It must rely on the experimentor's ability to recognize the limits of the model's applicabillity, of its context and usefulness.
	Empirical models cannot predict the future. They may represent a possible shadow the future may cast, but they will only ever truly reflect the past they are based on. They cannot take novel, new events into account until after they have happened. By definition, an empirical model cannot account for things that occur outside its context. Thus, models may appear to be more accurate when they are based on more information, when their applicable context is expanded through the inclusion of as much past data as possible. This is a flawed view of modeling. A complex model can never be as beautiful, as simple, or as subtle as reality.
	Very few variables in biogeochemical processes are truly independent. When a single-input model takes into account another input variable that is highly dependent upon (or directly coupled to) the first, the variance of the model's uncertainty is exponentially increased on the order of the number of dependent variables. For climate models, there are at least six variables being modeled based on
	If a model could approach an accurate prediction of the past while linearizing towards the fewest possible number of variables, it would be far more useful and more sensitive to current conditions.
